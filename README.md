## EXplanation:

`HTML Code:`

I created an HTML document for an "Auto Save Textarea" web page. It has a button for toggling a dark theme and a container with a heading, a textarea, and a "Clear All" button. The textarea allows users to input text, and I used the SVG icon for the toggle button.

`CSS Code:`

In the CSS, I've styled the page layout, fonts, and background. I defined both light and dark theme styles, which can be toggled by clicking the button with smooth transitions. The container has a border, shadow, and a blur effect.

`JS Code:`

I used JavaScript to enable auto-saving for the textarea content. If there's previously saved content, it loads it into the textarea. Users' input is stored in local storage. I also implemented a "Clear All" function to remove saved data. Additionally, the dark theme can be toggled with a button that changes its icon when clicked. The dark theme modifies the background and text colors.

The entire web page is responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes for a better user experience.
